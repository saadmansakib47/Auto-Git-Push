# Auto-Git-Push

Automate the process of pushing solved problem files to your GitHub repository for online judges like Codeforces or Leetcode.

## Important Notes

- **Supported File Types**: Works for `.cpp` and `.py` files.
- **Automatic Commits**: Each time you solve a problem and run the script, the file is uploaded to your GitHub repository with a commit message indicating the file's name.

## How to Use

### 1. Setup

- Ensure your GitHub repository is set up locally and initialized with Git.
- Place the script in your desired directory or project folder.

### 2. Usage

- Simply double-click the `Github_Automator.exe` file each time you solve a problem.
- The script will automatically commit and push your `.cpp` or `.py` file to the GitHub repository with a commit message based on the file's name.

### 3. Changing the Folder Path

- If your directory path differs from the default one in the script ("C:\Codeforces_Solved_Problems"), I will add a config file in the
  later version, but for now you can rename or replace the directory according to the script's default one.

## Requirements

- **Git**: Must be installed and configured with your GitHub credentials.
